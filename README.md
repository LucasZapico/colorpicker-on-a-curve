# Gradient Color Picker on a Curve

The inspiration for this project came from the requirement for a color scale in any modern application. A few reasons for this are; 

Consistent color usage keeps an application or website looking and feeling planned which keeps users and audiences engaged and building trust. 

## Use Case 

Most tools do direct linear scale between two tones. Some extend this with tint, and shade scales. But the tonal scale is whatever the designer/developer decides.

In many designs, a direct linear scale just isn't quite right. This is where the inspiration for this micro tool came from. I am hoping that being able to get a scale on a curve between two points on a HSL picker will enable more unique scales while maintaining the mathematical and geometric reason behind the color scales used in a design.
